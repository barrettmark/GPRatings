<p class='blue'>This app uses over 42 million patient entries to help people choose the best GP Surgeries in their local area.</p>

<p>Our data is sourced from the national 2011/12 GP Patient Survey conducted by Ipsos MORI (an independent survey agency) on behalf of the Department of Health. Outcomes data has been sourced from the Health and Social Care Information Centre.</p>

<p>This app transforms the survey responses and outcomes data into star ratings by scoring the feedback from for every surgery, and then comparing the overall figure nationally. Surgeries overall scores are calculated by adding their scores for each survey question, and then comparing nationally.</p>
 
<p>Surfacing the information in this app is designed to help patient choice, so you can find the right surgery based on other peoples feedback.</p>

<p>Full app details can be found on <a href="http://www.finefettleapps.com/">our website</a>, please use its feedback form to suggest enhancements. If you would like us to develop your app idea please <a href="mailto:ayup@finefettleapps.com">get in touch</a>.</p>
